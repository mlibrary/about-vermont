<p class="lead">Supporting the University of Vermont Press with a financial gift is a practical, visible, and innovative way to make a meaningful contribution to our research university.</p>

Founded in 2023, the University of Vermont Press publishes scholarly books and academic journals under a diamond open access model. Unlike the popular gold model of open access publishing, in which authors pay thousands of dollars in pay-to-play fees in exchange for free readership, the diamond open access model eliminates any and all author processing charges. This means authors pay nothing to publish with us and readers can freely view our work whenever and wherever they want. Fully funded by the University of Vermont, the UVM Press provides immediate online, global access to its books and journals, bringing a much needed and new level of accessibility and equity to the often expensive and exclusive business of scholarly publishing. 

The UVM Press relies entirely on institutional funding to support our goal of bringing important and relevant scholarship to the local, state, national, and global communities that the University of Vermont serves in its capacity as Vermont’s flagship public research university. At the same time, philanthropy plays a key part in the future success of UVM Press.

## Your Gift Helps UVM Press Authors and Readers

In today’s competitive academic marketplace, funding the publication of research is as essential as funding the research itself. With more financial resources at our disposal, the UVM Press can market and promote our titles to a wider audience, offer authors the critical financial resources needed to cover expenses such as travel and research costs, and subsidize what can be prohibitively expensive production and design overhead—all while continuing to promote our mission and attract new authors at national and international academic conferences.

## Your Gift Helps Us Make Research Freely Available to All

When considering a donation to the University of Vermont, please keep the UVM Press in mind. Every donation matters. Even small amounts go a long way toward providing our press and our authors the tools we need to make world-class research freely available to all, serving the university’s mission of empowering people and planet.
