<p class="lead">Fully funded by the university, the UVM Press uses a diamond open-access model to ensure free readership, free authorship, and immediate online, global access to all its published titles.</p>

<p class="lead">Established in 2023, the University of Vermont Press is a division of the University of Vermont Libraries, funded by the University of Vermont.</p>

The UVM Press is a diamond open-access, born-digital university press that publishes peer-reviewed journals, books, and special projects in support of the university’s distinctive research strengths—the health of our environment and our societies.

We operate in support of the fundamental mission of all academic libraries: to make knowledge and information freely available and readily accessible to everyone in need. That mission often stands at odds with the current, inequitable system of scholarly publishing, which passes costs on to researchers and readers. Through the UVM Press, the UVM Libraries are creating new ways for local and global patrons to access information. We are also part of a global movement to develop sustainable practices in scholarly publication. 

**The UVM Press serves the community.**
UVM is a land-grant institution founded for the public at large. The UVM Press makes scholarly research available to all—our local, national, and global community members.

**The UVM Press shares essential information.**
We recognize the connection between higher education and a healthy democracy and commit to making our published research accessible to all.

**The UVM Press encourages diversity of thought.**
We provide a venue for completing views to engage in conversation. The UVM Press will model the types of thoughtful, rigorous, factually informed debate in increasingly short supply in the public square.

**The UVM Press improves understanding.**
Our publications enhance understanding of the liberal arts, environment, health, and public service. 

## Our Partners
The UVM Press collaborates with leading scholars and scholarly societies to develop innovative publishing projects. Affiliation with UVM is not a prerequisite for publishing with the UVM Press.

We partner with scholarly societies and their representatives to establish new open-access journals or to transition existing journals to an open-access platform. We also partner with scholars at all career stages to develop books and book series in their areas of expertise.

## Our Publishing Model
Our publishing model is built on shared responsibilities and a commitment not to profit, in any way, from published material. Collaborators agree to:

* Publish digitally under a diamond open-access model, using Creative Commons licenses
* Utilize only the publishing platforms and resources provided by UVM Press
* Forgo all processing charges, subscription fees, and membership requirements associated with their published material
* Engage in a fair, rigorous peer review process
* Maintain a rolling publication schedule (for journal articles)

## Our Services
Staffed by two editorial directors—one for the books division and one for the journals division—the UVM Press provides consultation, strategy, editorial, and production services on a case-by-case basis.

We also provide access to, training on, and support services for the publishing platforms that host our published journal content.
