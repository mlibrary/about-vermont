The University of Vermont Press collaborates with leading scholars and scholarly societies to develop innovative publishing projects. Affiliation with the University of Vermont is not a prerequisite for publishing with the UVM Press.

We partner with scholarly societies and their representatives to establish new, diamond open access journals or to transition existing journals to a diamond open access platform. We also partner with scholars at all career stages to develop books and book series in their areas of expertise.

## Our Publishing Model

Our publishing model is built on shared responsibilities and a commitment not to profit, in any way, from published material. UVM Press collaborators agree to:

* Publish digitally under a diamond open access model, using Creative Commons licenses
* Utilize only the publishing platforms and resources provided by UVM Press
* Forgo all processing charges, subscription fees, and membership requirements associated with their published material
* Engage in a fair, rigorous peer review process
* Maintain a rolling publication schedule (for journal articles)

## Our Services

Staffed by two editorial directors—one for the books division and one for the journals division—the UVM Press provides consultation, strategy, editorial, and production services on a case-by-case basis.

The UVM Press also provides access to, training on, and support services for the online publishing platform we use for journal article submissions, peer review, production, and publication.
