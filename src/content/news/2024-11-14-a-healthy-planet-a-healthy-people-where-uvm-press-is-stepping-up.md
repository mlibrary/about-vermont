*By Caroline Deir*

The health of our planet and the health of its people are inextricably linked. Recognizing this crucial connection, the University of Vermont and the University of Vermont Press are taking big steps forward as they wade into the global conversations happening around planetary health. UVM Press shares the university's commitment to research and education that promotes healthy environments and communities. As part of a land-grant institution, UVM Press believes that this vital knowledge shouldn't be locked away behind paywalls, a belief reflected in its mission – to make information freely available to everyone: within the university, nationally, and beyond.

Planetary health, a rapidly growing field, focuses on the interconnectedness of human and environmental well-being. Through the recent launch of the university’s [Planetary Health Initiative](https://www.uvm.edu/planetaryhealthinitiative), UVM is positioning itself as a frontrunner in this interdisciplinary campaign, actively spearheading and amplifying climate and people-centered research. 

By publishing high-quality, open-access scholarship, the Press is breaking down barriers to knowledge and empowering researchers to address critical environmental and social challenges. This can be seen in the *Journal of Ecological Design* *(JEED)*. First published in 2023, *JEED* is a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that provides a platform for researchers to share innovative solutions to complex environmental problems. The journal contributes to the development of sustainable and resilient communities – the same kind of communities that the Planetary Health Initiative is trying to build. 

UVM Press is also stepping up to the global conversation on planetary health by being a proud member of the Planetary Health Alliance, a global network committed to advancing planetary health research and action. It’s made up of universities, non-profits, political organizations, and more from around the world. Each member of the alliance recognizes the issues that climate change brings to the planet, along with its greater implications for our population. 

Ultimately, UVM Press is grateful for the support of the University of Vermont in pursuing this crucial mission. Their commitment to publishing high-quality, peer-reviewed scholarship in planetary health empowers researchers and educators to share knowledge that contributes to a healthier future for people and planet.
