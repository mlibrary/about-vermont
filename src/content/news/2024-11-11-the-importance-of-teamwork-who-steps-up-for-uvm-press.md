Like most university presses, the University of Vermont Press cannot run properly without the work and collaboration of book authors, scholarly societies, and our university itself. As a diamond open access press, which operates under an open access model that ensures free access to its published research and scholarship and does not charge article or book processing charges, we provide important information to those who may not be able to access it through another platform. 

Our publishing partners are stepping up with us and supporting our diamond open access model. Their values align with those that make our organization not-for-profit, which aligns with our goal of making our society and environment healthier and more accessible to everyone. Book authors we work with are collaborative and hardworking when providing important information to readers. What they do is essential to the growth and development of knowledge in general and the success of UVM Press as a newly launched organization.

We are currently working on publishing book projects by trusted authors who are stepping up in meaningful ways. One example is a contributed volume on the importance of “walkability” within major towns or cities across the world. This book will raise awareness of the need to improve accessibility in places where those with disabilities or impairments may have a difficult time getting from one location to another in a timely manner. Another exciting book project is a history of Landmark College, a private college located in Putney, Vermont. Founded in 1985, Landmark caters to students with learning disabilities, autism, ADHD, or other learning challenges. 

Along with book authors, the scholars, researchers, and professionals who work with UVM Press step up to advocate for our diamond open access models. They contribute countless hours of their time and expertise. Scholarly societies partner with us to publish peer-reviewed online journals showcasing extensive research in their fields. The American Ecological Engineering Society partners with UVM Press to publish the *[Journal of Ecological Engineering Design](https://jeed.pubpub.org)*, which is UVM Press’s first journal. Additionally, the Society for Black Military Studies recently joined us to establish the forthcoming *Journal of Black Military Studies*. 

Finally, the University of Vermont and UVM Libraries step up for UVM Press in essential ways. We are grateful that the university believes in what we publish and how we publish it. Our work supports UVM’s core mission as a land-grant institution, to provide education and a public service to the people of Vermont and beyond. UVM’s mission statement is to be among the nation’s premier research universities with a comprehensive commitment to liberal arts education, environment, health, and public service, a mission supported by UVM Libraries and the University of Vermont Press.
