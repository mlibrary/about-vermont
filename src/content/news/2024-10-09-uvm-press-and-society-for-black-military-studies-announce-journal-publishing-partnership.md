BURLINGTON, Vt. (October 9, 2024)—The University of Vermont (UVM) Press and the Society for Black Military Studies have partnered to establish the forthcoming *Journal of Black Military Studies*, an international, multi-disciplinary, peer-reviewed journal that encapsulates the military experience (broadly defined) within and throughout the Black Diaspora.

The *Journal of Black Military Studies* will showcase innovative, dynamic approaches to analyzing, preserving, and disseminating histories, heritages, arts, politics, discourse, and literature of war and military participation within the Black Diaspora. It will be published digitally under a diamond open access model, enabling authors to publish accepted work without publication fees, and readers to access all journal content without paywalls.

Dr. Françoise N. Hamlin, Brown University’s Royce Family Associate Professor of Teaching Excellence in Africana Studies and History, will serve as the journal’s inaugural editor in chief.

Dr. Le’Trice D. Donaldson, President of the Society for Black Military Studies and Assistant Professor of African-American History at Auburn University, is eager to develop this new journal. “We were drawn to the UVM Press for the services and expertise it offers to new and small scholarly societies,” said Donaldson, “and for its commitment to diamond open access publishing, which aligns with our society’s values.”

“By publishing its journal under a diamond open access model, the Society for Black Military Studies makes an important contribution to equity in scholarship,” said Aimee Diehl, editorial director of journals for the UVM Press. “The *Journal of Black Military Studies* will be free to any internet user, anywhere in the world, and scholars in the field will be able to share their knowledge without the burden of publication fees.”

**About the Society for Black Military Studies**\
The Society for Black Military Studies (SBMS) was founded in 2022 to promote understanding of, appreciation for, and greater dialogue about the Black military experience. Its mission is to provide greater coherence to the field of study and to preserve, analyze, and disseminate histories, heritages, arts, and literature that focus on the lives and legacies of Black military service members globally. Members of SBMS include scholars from all disciplines, as well as community members, who are interested in exploring and expanding the narratives of soldiers of African descent from all branches, veterans, military family life, paramilitary organizations, militias, and self-defense practitioners.
