The University of Vermont Press, a diamond open access academic press committed to bringing new opportunities and greater equity to scholarly publishing, and Michigan Publishing Services, a global leader in the advancement and dissemination of digital scholarship, have partnered to digitally distribute UVM Press book titles free of charge, to any internet user, anywhere in the world. 

Visitors to the new UVM Press website, [press.uvm.edu](press.uvm.edu), can read the press’s peer-reviewed scholarly book titles online in a web browser, download an ePub for use with a tablet or eReader, or download a PDF file for printing instantly, all without membership requirements or fees. The website is powered by Michigan Publishing Services’s open-source Fulcrum publishing platform, which was developed by the University of Michigan Libraries. 

The UVM Press editorial team acquires and develops research for publication, while Michigan Publishing Services staff provide digital publishing expertise, production assistance, and distribution services.

Thomas W. Krause, UVM Press editorial director for books, is excited to collaborate with a proven industry leader. “Michigan Publishing Services has the combined technical and professional expertise that will help the UVM Press grow and thrive,” said Krause.  “We’re pleased to partner with an organization that shares our mission: to make high quality, free open access scholarship a more visible and viable option for scholars, students, and all readers.”

The UVM Press publishes peer-reviewed book and journal titles that explore topics related to healthy environments and healthy communities in alignment with the university’s strategic imperatives. Its first publication was the *Journal of Ecological Engineering Design*, the journal of the American Ecological Engineering Society. Forthcoming UVM Press books include monographs and contributed volumes in the fields of public and planetary health, religion, and New England history. Authors working on book projects in these areas, and scholarly societies interested in establishing new or migrating existing peer-reviewed journals, are encouraged to contact the UVM Press to discuss publication.
