BURLINGTON, Vt. (September 2, 2025)—The [University of Vermont (UVM) Press](https://press.uvm.edu) and the [Middle Grades Collaborative](https://middlegradescollaborative.org/) have partnered to migrate *[Middle Grades Review (MGR)](https://journals.uvm.edu/mgr)*, the Collaborative’s diamond open access journal, to a new, open-source scholarly publishing platform. Readers and prospective authors can access all of the journal’s published content at its new URL, <https://journals.uvm.edu/mgr>. The journal remains entirely free for authors and readers.

*MGR* is a peer-reviewed, diamond open access journal for scholars and practitioners who wish to broaden the discourse of middle grades education by challenging conventional wisdom. It provides a provocative forum for debate within the field of middle grades education. Inviting a critical perspective, *MGR* seeks pieces that explore three themes: Democratic Education, Innovation, and Social Justice in relation to middle grades education and young adolescents. Dr. James Nagle (St. Michael’s College) and Dr. Kathleen Brinegar (University of Vermont) serve as the journal’s co-editors. The journal is abstracted/indexed in Cabell’s, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).

This partnership allows *MGR*, now in its 11th year of publication, to publish on a rolling schedule and enhance its digital accessibility. The journal now publishes new content on acceptance, making it available to readers sooner. By publishing articles in both HTML and downloadable PDF formats, *MGR* is more compatible with assistive technologies like screen readers, improving access for people with disabilities.

*MGR*’s new publishing platform, Janeway, is a sustainable scholarly publishing tool developed and maintained by the Open Library of Humanities, a part of Birkbeck, University of London. It is made available through an agreement between UVM Press and Michigan Publishing.

*MGR* was published by the University of Vermont Libraries on ScholarWorks, the institutional repository for the University of Vermont, from April 2015 to December 2024.
