The University of Vermont (UVM) Press is dedicated to publishing academic writing that highlights the connections between human and environmental health. As a part of the University of Vermont, the UVM Press aligns with the university’s commitment to planetary health, demonstrated through UVM Press’s membership in the Planetary Health Alliance. This global consortium emphasizes the relationship between ecological stability and human well-being, an idea that directly informs the Press’s mission. This discourse has brought up one of the most interesting metaphors in planetary health research: the human body as a microcosm of the planet.

The boundaries between humans and nature are not as distinct as some might assume. David Victorson, of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, expands on this idea by saying, “Our bodies are made of water, air, soil, and sun. The microbes in our gut mirror the biodiversity of a healthy forest floor. The oxygen in our blood was once in the leaves of trees. If we get our drinking water from Lake Michigan, we are a living embodiment of Lake Michigan.”

The realization that there is no true separation between humans and nature is both unsettling and awe-inspiring. This inseparability raises questions such as: Can we even discuss whole health without recognizing the environments that sustain us? How do we ensure that environmental justice is central to our conversations about health equity? What responsibilities do we bear in reshaping our systems to reflect the interconnectedness of all life? 

Perhaps the solution lies in embracing a new era: the Symbiocene. This is a term coined by environmental philosopher Glenn Albrecht to describe an age in which humans recognize themselves as active participants in ecological systems rather than separate entities. If we could perceive ourselves as part of nature, our approach to health, sustainability, and conservation would shift. As Victorson goes on to say, “Planetary health is not a distant issue—it is a mirror. Our health is inseparable from the health of our air, water, soil, and climate. When we understand the body as an ecosystem, not just metaphorically, but biologically, we begin to see that caring for the planet is a form of self-care. To heal one is to heal the other. It is all one body. We are not just in an environment; we are the environment. What we breathe, eat, and drink becomes who we are, literally. Every policy that protects clean water, every act of conservation, is an act of honoring the water and soil within us.” Instead of mitigating damage, we could prioritize co-existence, fostering symbiotic relationships that benefit both human and planetary health.

The metaphor of the human body as a microcosm of the planet is more than food for thought. It is a call to action. Just as we strive for personal well-being through nutrition, exercise, and healthcare, we must extend the same care to the planet through sustainable practices, conservation, and policy. UVM Press remains committed to publishing research that advances this understanding, reinforcing the idea to treat planetary health with the same urgency and dedication that we afford human health.
